## Development Workflow Guidelines

### Daily Development Process
1. **Start each day** by reviewing current task progress
2. **Use Cursor AI** with the provided prompts, referencing specified documentation files
3. **Break down large tasks** into smaller sub-tasks if context becomes too large
4. **Test incrementally** after each sub-task completion
5. **Update progress status** in this document
6. **Commit code** with descriptive messages referencing task numbers

### Task Management Tips
- **Don't skip dependencies** - they're designed to build on each other
- **Test thoroughly** before marking tasks complete
- **Update documentation** as you build
- **Keep tasks focused** - if a task feels too big, break it down further
- **Reference the project files** in every Cursor prompt for consistency

### Quality Assurance
- Each task should include **testing and validation**
- **Mobile responsiveness** should be checked for every UI task
- **Performance impact** should be considered for each feature
- **Security implications** should be reviewed for data handling tasks
